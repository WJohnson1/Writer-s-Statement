		One of my favorite toys growing up were Legos. I would build massive construction pieces from the leftovers of old construction sets, much to my mom’s dismay. This activity might demonstrate my knack for engineering things and that is what I considered one of my strengths for a while. However, once I started reminiscing about my experiences during those days, I can’t help but realize that I had another hidden interest. Storytelling. That’s what I spent countless hours for numerous days doing. It’s not necessarily the same thing but I believe if that creativity could have been expressed better, I could be a better writer today. But my subsequent experiences with writing never allowed it to flourish which is why I didn’t enjoy for a majority of my life.

		During my middle school years, I was an all A+ student in every subject except one: Language Arts. Whenever I wrote something for the class, I always made mistakes and I could never understand why I had messed up. I wanted to get better at writing but initially I was unable to achieve the standard that my Language Arts teacher had wanted. As time went on, I “corrected” my writing style to receive better grades. However, when the next school year rolled around, the writing style that I had adopted for my previous teacher was now unacceptable for my current teacher. So, every year I had to repeat this process over again to receive better grades. Eventually, I developed a writing style that was always geared towards getting good grades. Whenever I tried to do creative writing, my grades suffered from the lack of clear, concise guidelines. For example, in my junior year, I was assigned a research paper to do. I was extremely certain that I would hate this writing assignment as much as I had the rest, but this was different. I was given the chance to choose a topic that I was passionate on and provide evidence to support your position. Standardized tests were just coming out and I was not happy with the scores I received so I choose to write my research paper about the devastation of student morals caused by standardized testing. When researching this topic, I was amazed about how interested I was in the project. Maybe it was because it was a topic that I held personal interests in, but this was my first breakthrough in my view on writing. However, despite the passion that I held for the paper, I still received a low grade on it. I received the low grade, not because of the content itself, but rather I had incorrectly included the tedious format that my teacher had wanted. I was angry that the effort I fad put into the project had yielded little results.
