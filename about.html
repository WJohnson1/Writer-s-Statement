	<p>
		I don’t particularly like writing or more accurately writing for school. My interests and pursuits have always leaned towards a scientific or technology focused career. However, I did enjoy writing about some of the topics that I read about during the MCAS Summer Bridge Program. Gee’s “Discourse, small-d, Big D” provide insights into how people can be separated into and defined by certain groups. Lee’s “Exploring Dominant Discourse”, describe how dominant discourses are a prominent part of society and how people deal with these discourses. Majors’ “Joy and the Smart Kids” retells the story of her daughter’s struggles in becoming part of a discourse where she felt uncomfortable with herself. I enjoyed writing about these articles because I could relate my own experiences to what was being described in the article and this made it easier to write about. These articles also helped me realize my own form of writing and how my style developed from my experiences.
