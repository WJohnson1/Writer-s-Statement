		This led me to grow a distaste for writing in general. However, at the MCAS Summer Bridge program, I could develop my own writing style. Again, I lacked clear, concise guidelines and I thought that my grades would suffer accordingly. However, my individual interpretations of the articles where encouraged instead of being discouraged. And tedious formats where not necessary for assignments. I was also able to relate the articles to my own personal experiences and this helped me find the words to formulate my thoughts. The combination of stories that I could relate to and lack of clear guidelines helped me to develop my own unique writing form.

		I would describe my writing style as primarily linear. As I previously mentioned, I had a knack for storytelling which has a clear beginning, middle, and end. This remains true for my writing style because I usually develop thoughts and ideas one after another. I have an extremely analytical brain and so, I approach writing topics the same way that I approach a math problem. I look at the original problem and take consecutive steps to until I get the results I am looking for. So, when I am tasked with writing in a non-linear style, I am often confused on how to fully develop my thoughts. I also struggle to understand pieces of writing that utilize a non-linear format (i.e. Majorâ€™s use of an interwoven narrative). I realize the usefulness of utilizing different writing styles, however currently I am only comfortable with my linear style, though I plan to write in other writing styles in order to diversify my own.
